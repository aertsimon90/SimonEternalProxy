## Proxy Details
Simon's Eternal Proxy offers three distinct proxy types, each tailored to meet specific needs while maintaining high standards of performance and security. All proxies operate through the address **45.89.28.226**, with unique ports for different protocols:

1. **HTTP Proxy**  
   - **Address**: 45.89.28.226:12980  
   - **Description**: This proxy is optimized for secure and stable HTTP communications, making it ideal for general web browsing, accessing APIs, or retrieving web content. It ensures that your web traffic is routed securely, protecting your data from interception and maintaining your anonymity. The HTTP proxy is lightweight and easy to configure, offering a reliable solution for most online activities.

2. **SOCKS4 Proxy**  
   - **Address**: 45.89.28.226:12914  
   - **Description**: The SOCKS4 proxy provides a versatile and robust connection, perfect for applications requiring network tunneling, such as file transfers, streaming, or peer-to-peer communications. It supports a wide range of protocols and is designed to deliver consistent performance, ensuring that your data remains private and your connection stable.

3. **SOCKS5H Proxy**  
   - **Address**: 45.89.28.226:12915  
   - **Description**: Our SOCKS5H proxy is the most advanced option, supporting enhanced authentication methods and UDP protocols. It is engineered for high-speed, secure data transfers, making it suitable for demanding tasks like gaming, video streaming, or accessing geo-restricted content. The SOCKS5H proxy ensures both performance and privacy, offering a seamless experience for users with complex networking needs.

Each proxy type is built with custom configurations to maximize security and efficiency. By routing your traffic through our infrastructure, Simon's Eternal Proxy ensures that your real IP address is concealed, providing a consistent and anonymous browsing experience.

## Usage Examples
To help you get started, we’ve provided detailed examples for integrating Simon's Eternal Proxy into your workflows using common tools like cURL and Python’s Requests library.

### cURL Examples
cURL is a powerful command-line tool for making HTTP requests. Below are examples of how to use each proxy type:

```bash
# HTTP Proxy
curl -x 45.89.28.226:12980 http://api.example.com

# SOCKS4 Proxy
curl -x socks4://45.89.28.226:12914 https://api.example.com

# SOCKS5H Proxy
curl -x socks5h://45.89.28.226:12915 https://api.example.com
```

These commands route your requests through the respective proxies, ensuring that your traffic is anonymized and secure.

### Python Requests Examples
For developers using Python, the Requests library is a popular choice for interacting with web services. Below are examples of how to configure the proxies:

```python
import requests

# HTTP Proxy
proxies = {
    "http": "http://45.89.28.226:12980",
    "https": "http://45.89.28.226:12980"
}
response = requests.get("http://api.example.com", proxies=proxies)
print(response.text)

# SOCKS4 Proxy (requires requests[socks] package)
proxies = {
    "http": "socks4://45.89.28.226:12914",
    "https": "socks4://45.89.28.226:12914"
}
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com", proxies=proxies)
print(response.text)

# SOCKS5H Proxy (requires requests[socks] package)
proxies = {
    "http": "socks5h://45.89.28.226:12915",
    "https": "socks5h://45.89.28.226:12915"
}
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com", proxies=proxies)
print(response.text)
```

**Note**: To use SOCKS proxies with Python, you’ll need to install the `requests[socks]` package (`pip install requests[socks]`). If you encounter errors while fetching content, they may be caused by unexpected whitespace in the response. Trimming these spaces manually should resolve the issue.

## Security and Anonymity
At Simon's Eternal Proxy, your privacy is our top priority. Our service employs sophisticated techniques to ensure that your online activities remain confidential. By routing your traffic through our proxies, we mask your real IP address, making it appear as though your requests originate from our servers. This process is enhanced by custom protocols that minimize the risk of data interception and ensure secure communication across all proxy types.

We take a firm stance on data privacy:  
- **No Logs**: We do not store any information about your browsing activities or connection details.  
- **No Credentials**: Since no account is required, there’s no need to provide personal information or login details.  
- **No Tracking**: Our infrastructure is designed to prevent tracking, ensuring that your online behavior remains private.

These measures collectively create a secure and anonymous environment, allowing you to browse, stream, or work online with confidence.

## Additional Notes
Simon's Eternal Proxy is more than just a tool—it’s a commitment to digital freedom. Our service is continuously monitored and updated to maintain optimal performance and reliability. Whether you’re bypassing geo-restrictions, protecting your identity, or simply exploring the internet privately, we’re here to support you every step of the way.

**Troubleshooting Tip**: On rare occasions, you may encounter errors when retrieving content due to extraneous whitespace. These can typically be resolved by manually trimming the affected content. We’re working to minimize such issues and appreciate your patience.
